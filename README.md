# Vagrant Box for Hardware Development and Hacking

This repository is work in progress and the basis of my hardware hacking work and FPGA development.

## Dependencies

The following things are necessary on your linux box:

- vagrant
- virtual box
- internet

## Usage

If you want to have a running virtual box instance, just do an _vagrant up_ in the directory of the repository. To create a _ova_ file you can use the script _create_kali_ova.sh_.
